STILL WORK IN PROGRESS
Battleship style game.  It first asks you to pick a spot for you battleship, then asks you to guess
the enemy's location.  The enemy also shoots at the player each turn, and code is put into place as
to insure that neither the player nor the enemy shoot/place their battleships in a stop that doesn't
make sense :D
"""
# Todo: fix the whole system at the bottom
# Todo: add a key after every time the board is printed so that people can actually know what's going on
# Todo: if a stop has already been guess, let the player guess again
# Todo: make it so that normally, the enemy can't guess their where their own ship is
# Todo: add a hard mode where the enemy CAN guess where their own ship is
# Todo: make it so that if you try and guess your own spot, it stops everything and makes you redo, because currently you can win by just guessing your spot again amd again
# Todo: on the last round, your battleship's "B" turns to a "Y"
# Todo: when the player wins, the board that is printed out doesn't show their winning move
# Todo: there is currently the possibility of a tie.  If that happens, make the player play a tie breaker round (until a winner is decided)
